# Chest-X-ray-image-classification
The  data contains two types of images 'NORMAL' and 'PNUMONIA'. The task is to classifying those images using CNN model and predicting unseen data with more than 80%  accuracy


Pneumonia is a very common disease. It can be either: 1) Bacterial pneumonia 2) Viral Pneumonia 3) Mycoplasma pneumonia and 4) Fungal pneumonia. This dataset consists pneumonia samples belonging to the first two classes. The dataset consists of only very few samples and that too unbalanced. The aim of this model is to develop a robust deep learning model from scratch on this limited amount of data. We all know that deep learning models needs more data or large data but if you know how things work, you can build good models even with a limited amount of data.
