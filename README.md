Pneumonia is a very common disease. It can be either: 1) Bacterial pneumonia 2) Viral Pneumonia 3) Mycoplasma pneumonia and 4) Fungal pneumonia. This dataset consists pneumonia samples belonging to the first two classes. The dataset consists of only very few samples and that too unbalanced. The aim of this model is to develop a robust deep learning model from scratch on this limited amount of data. We all know that deep learning models needs more data or large data but if you know how things work, you can build good models even with a limited amount of data.

When you get pneumonia -- whether it was caused by bacteria, a virus, or a fungus -- there's a chance it could lead to other medical troubles. Learn the signs of these complications and get treatment right away to keep any health problems you get under control.
Bacteremia and Septic Shock
If bacteria caused your pneumonia, they could get into your blood, especially if you didn't see a doctor for treatment. It's a problem called bacteremia.
Bacteremia can lead to a serious situation known as septic shock. It's a reaction to the infection in your blood, and it can cause your blood pressure to drop to a dangerous level.
When your blood pressure is too low, your heart may not be able to pump enough blood to your organs, and they can stop working. Get medical help right away if you notice symptoms like:

•	Fever

•	Fast heart rate

•	Fast breathing

•	Chills that make you shiver

•	Low blood pressure

•	Stomach upset (nausea, pain, vomiting, or diarrhea)

•	Mental confusion

Your doctor will test your blood for bacteria and treat you with antibiotics if you have bacteremia. You may get treated in the hospital for bacteremia or septic shock.
